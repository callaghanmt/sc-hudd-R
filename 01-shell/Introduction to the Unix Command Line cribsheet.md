## Introduction to the Unix Command Line

###General tips

* Uppercase and lowercase letters are different:
A file called `thesis.txt` is different from `Thesis.txt` and `tHeSiS.tXt`
* Depending on the terminal/ ssh client you are using you might be able to copy-paste from one window to another
* Press the up and down arrows on your keyboard to cycle through previous commands
* Tab will autocomplete file/directory names when typing commands
* Be careful with spaces when writing commands - spaces should separate each option or argument

|`mv <file-name> <path>`	|move a file to another folder|
|`rm <file-name>`	|delete a file|
|`rm -r <directory>`	|delete a directory and all of its contents|

|`seq 5 10`	|print a sequence from 5 to 10|
|`seq 1 2 9`	|print a sequence from 1 to 9 with a stride of 2|
|`seq -f %03g 1 2 9`	|print a sequence padded with zeroes to the left|
|`for i in $(seq 1 5); do echo iteration$i; done`|	loop through a sequence and repeat the same instruction for each value|
|`for ((i=1; i<=5; i++)); do echo iteration$i; done`|	alternative method for looping through a sequence|
